Package One:
	The Shape interface was given as part of this task. The classes triangle, circle, and rectangle were implemented using this interface and tested with JUnit (ShapeTests.java). Each 
	
Package Two:
	In the main method 2 collections are defined, one contains integers 1 thru 10 in a random order and the other contains 6 thru 15 in a random order. Both collections are printed and their size is printed following the collection. These are implemented with Lists for their variable size. It also allows us to easily reverse the list.
	
	These two collections are then combined into a third collection which is implemented as a TreeSet so that it is automatically sorted. The middle entry of the set is removed and the set is printed in reverse order with its size immediately following
	
	Finally, a List of key/value pairs is created. This uses the class KeyValue which implements the Map.Entry interface. Five pairs are added to the collection, a duplicate is then added and found in the collection. The pairs are printed with the size immediately following.

Package Three:
